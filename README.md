## Introduction

When you find yourself writing repetitive code, it's time to extract it into a plugin.

Wechaty has a great support for using Plugins by calling `Wechaty.use(WechatyPlugin())`. A Wechaty Plugin is a JavaScript function that returns a function which accepts a Wechaty instance.

The first Wechaty Plugin system was design by our core team developer [@gcaufy](https://github.com/gcaufy) from issue [#1939](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/issues/1939)(Wechaty Plugin Support with Kickout Example) to PR [#1946](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/pull/1946)(feat: added wechaty plugin).

This package is for publishing the Wechaty Plugins that are very common used by the core developer team.

## Requirements

1. Wechaty v0.39.25 or above versions

## Wechaty Plugin Directory

The Wechaty Plugin Contrib will only accept simple plugins which does not dependence very heavy NPM modules, and the SLOC (Source Line Of Code) is no more than 100.
